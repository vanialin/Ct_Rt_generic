Generalizing population RT-qPCR cycle threshold values-informed estimation of epidemiological dynamics: Impact of surveillance practices and pathogen variability. medRxiv. 2025.05.22.25328079; doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.05.22.25328079.**

# Repository Structure
* Script 1.0: Sets up simulated surveillance scenarios.
* Script 1.1: Estimates incidence-based Rt for each scenario.
* Scripts 1.2–1.5: Compares results across scenarios and investigates factors affecting estimation accuracy.
* Scripts 2.0–2.2: Simulates and compares scenarios with different pathogen shedding kinetics.
* Scripts 3.1–3.3: Applies parameters from real-world pathogens (SARS-CoV-2 variants, SARS-CoV-1, and influenza A) and evaluates method performance in these scenarios.
